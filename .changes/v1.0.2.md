## v1.0.2 - 2024-08-15


### 🐛 Bug Fix

- Trunk upgrade was set to install, not upgrade tooling, so now it does what it should have done in the first place... before the coder in question got in way and didn't use his noggin.
- Since mage is typically not precompiled, the normal build directives for darwin, linux, windows don't apply. Instead, the logic needs to be just runtime evaluation in the same code not broken apart by files.
This fixes it, improves logging for trunk setup, and does general dep upgrades.

### 🔨 Developer Experience

- Improve the error output with shellescape library so the command that failed can be rerun manually easily.

### 🔨 Refactor

- Trunk package now supports installing for windows, via the newer trunk npm based install, while maintaining the bash install for linux/darwin.
If the project has a package.json, then it will install as dev dependency, otherwise as a global tool.
No logic to detect alternative tooling such as yarn, bun, deno, etc unless requested.
While trunk also supports this method of installation for Darwin/Linux, I've opted to keep it the same as before and use the bash install method for those regardless if package.json is there or not.
