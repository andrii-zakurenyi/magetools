```go
const (
    // ArtifactDirectory is where we drop built artifacts, like the temporary kubeconfig contents. This is an ephemeral workspace.
    ArtifactDirectory = ".artifacts"
    // CachedDirectory contains files locally built and used, but not to commit to source control, and not a typical file in the artifact directory that can be regularly purged during rebuilds.
    CachedDirectory = "~/.cache/kubeconfigs"
    // Kubectrl is the name of the kubectl binary, in case you want to provide a fully qualified path for some reason.
    Kubectl = "kubectl"
    // PermissionUserReadWriteExecute is the octal permission for read, write, & execute only for owner.
    PermissionUserReadWriteExecute = 0o0700
)
```

    // Namespace is the Kubernetes namespace to use for the context and to get the service account from.
    Namespace string
